- **Focus**: Market index trends, historical performance, and index composition

### 2. Stock Market Price Gathering (`02_Stock_Market_Price_Gathering/`)
- **Purpose**: Individual stock price data collection and processing
- **Focus**: Stock price movements, volume analysis, and market trends

### 3. Census Bureau Demographics Gathering (`03_Census_Bureau_Demographics_Gathering/`)
- **Purpose**: Demographic data collection from U.S. Census Bureau
- **Focus**: Population trends, economic indicators, and demographic analysis

### 4. Consumer Spending & Inflation Gathering (`04_Consumer_Spending_Inflation_Gathering/`)
- **Purpose**: Consumer spending patterns and inflation data analysis
- **Focus**: Economic indicators, spending trends, and inflation metrics

## Directory Structure
